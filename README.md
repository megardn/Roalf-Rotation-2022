Rotation project investigating the ability of GluCEST contrast in the thalamus to predict clinical progression.
Further notes about the project are on LabArchives.

Scripts stored under `clinical` are intended to be run locally and expect inputs from untracked subdirectory `data`.

Scripts stored under `cest` are intended to be run on PMACS in the `bbl_roalf_cest_predict` project.
